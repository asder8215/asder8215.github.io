                    Hello! My name is Mahdi Ali-Raihan. I'm currently a senior at Columbia University studying Computer Science. My primary interest lies in low level systems programming, AI, mobile app development, and fintech. I'm open to learning about other fields in CS though!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In my free time, I like to read books, watch shows/animes, play Ping Pong/Badminton, play some games on my PC/PS5/Nintendo Switch, or work on some coding projects. I'm also currently learning how to play the ukulele.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From time to time, I'll update this website and you can look through my education, experiences, projects, hobbies, and what I'm up to currently in the terminal. Currently, the commands supported by the terminal are: cd, clear, help, ls, pwd, stat. Use 'help' to see detailed usage of the commands.
