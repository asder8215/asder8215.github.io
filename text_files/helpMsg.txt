Currently the commands available for this web terminal are:

- cd [path]       : Changes the current directory to the provided path by user. Only allows one path name to be supplied. If no path is supplied, it stays in the current directory. 

- clear           : Erases all information currently displayed on the terminal.

- help            : Displays this help message for users to refer back to for information about commands currently offered.

- ls <:d> [path]  : List all directories and files to either the provided path or if no path is provided to the current path. The '-d' flag can be used to present the files in chronological order (may be of interest in experiences or project folder). 

- pwd             : Prints out the current working directory.

- stat [path]     : Displays the data/content associated with a specific directory or file from path provided by user. If no path is provided, displays the data associated with the current directory.

- Note: Any commands here can be autocompleted with two tab button clicks. The same could be done [path] arguments. '.' path refers to current directory. '..' path refers to parent directory. You can also use '~' to immediately go to the home directory.
