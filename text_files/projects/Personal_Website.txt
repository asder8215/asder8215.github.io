<em>June 2024 - Present</em>
&bull; Utilized jQuery Terminal package to build a terminal-based personal website that contains information about my education, experience, projects, and any other miscellaneous topics
&bull; Commands are built from scratch and so far this terminal allows user to navigate through cd, list files and directories in the terminal through ls, display information within each file & directory through stat, and a few other commands have been implemented
&bull; Google Fonts and a bit of Bootstrap were used for icons and styling text
