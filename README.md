This is my personal website that contains some information about me. It features a terminal on the right side of the site, which you can navigate through it and learn more about my education, experiences, projects, etc. Currently, the supported commands are: cd, clear, help, ls, pwd, stat. You can use the 'help' command to get further information on how to use the commands and what they do. 

I'll update the website every now and then with new information and possibly new commands. Thanks for dropping by!
